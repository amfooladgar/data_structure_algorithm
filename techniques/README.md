## 📚 Available Resources

### [Backtracking](./backtracking)
**Master the backtracking algorithm pattern**

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding solutions by trying partial solutions and abandoning them if they don't lead to a valid solution.

**Common Applications:**
- Permutations and combinations
- Subset generation
- N-Queens problem
- Sudoku solver
- Path finding in mazes
- Constraint satisfaction problems

**Key Concepts:**
- Decision trees
- Pruning invalid branches
- State management
- Recursive exploration
- Backtrack conditions
