    "Hint\n",
    "You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\n",
    "Output: 28\n",
    "Explanation: To convert the string \"abcd\" to string \"acbe\":\n",
    "- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\n",
    "- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\n",
    "- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\n",
    "- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\n",
    "The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\n",
    "It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\n",

    "Input: source = \"aaaa\", target = \"bbbb\", original = [\"a\",\"c\"], changed = [\"c\",\"b\"], cost = [1,2]\n",
    "Output: 12\n",
    "Explanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: source = \"abcd\", target = \"abce\", original = [\"a\"], changed = [\"e\"], cost = [10000]\n",

    "1 <= cost[i] <= 106\n",
    "original[i] != changed[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1\n",
    "Construct a graph with each letter as a node, and construct an edge (a, b) with weight c if we can change from character a to letter b with cost c. (Keep the one with the smallest cost in case there are multiple edges between a and b).\n",
    "Hint 2\n",
    "Calculate the shortest path for each pair of characters (source[i], target[i]). The sum of cost over all i in the range [0, source.length - 1]. If there is no path between source[i] and target[i], the answer is -1.\n",
    "Hint 3\n",
    "Any shortest path algorithms will work since we only have 26 nodes. Since we only have at most 26 * 26 pairs, we can save the result to avoid re-calculation.\n",

    "Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)\n",

After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.\n",

A special substring is just a line that starts and ends at the same y-coordinate, and that is the lowest y-coordinate reached. Call a mountain a special substring with no special prefixes - ie. only at the beginning and end is the lowest y-coordinate reached. If F is the answer function, and S has mountain decomposition M1,M2,M3,...,Mk, then the answer is: reverse_sorted(F(M1), F(M2), ..., F(Mk)). However, you'll also need to deal with the case that S is a mountain, such as 11011000 -> 11100100."
