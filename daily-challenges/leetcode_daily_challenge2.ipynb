    "# 2976. Minimum Cost to Convert String I\n",
    "Medium\n",

    "Hint\n",
    "You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\n",
    "Output: 28\n",
    "Explanation: To convert the string \"abcd\" to string \"acbe\":\n",
    "- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\n",
    "- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\n",
    "- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\n",
    "- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\n",
    "The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\n",
    "It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: source = \"aaaa\", target = \"bbbb\", original = [\"a\",\"c\"], changed = [\"c\",\"b\"], cost = [1,2]\n",
    "Output: 12\n",
    "Explanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: source = \"abcd\", target = \"abce\", original = [\"a\"], changed = [\"e\"], cost = [10000]\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= source.length == target.length <= 105\n",
    "source, target consist of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000\n",
    "original[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.\n",
    "1 <= cost[i] <= 106\n",
    "original[i] != changed[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1\n",
    "Construct a graph with each letter as a node, and construct an edge (a, b) with weight c if we can change from character a to letter b with cost c. (Keep the one with the smallest cost in case there are multiple edges between a and b).\n",
    "Hint 2\n",
    "Calculate the shortest path for each pair of characters (source[i], target[i]). The sum of cost over all i in the range [0, source.length - 1]. If there is no path between source[i] and target[i], the answer is -1.\n",
    "Hint 3\n",
    "Any shortest path algorithms will work since we only have 26 nodes. Since we only have at most 26 * 26 pairs, we can save the result to avoid re-calculation.\n",
    "Hint 4\n",
    "We can also use Floyd Warshall's algorithm to precompute all the results."
